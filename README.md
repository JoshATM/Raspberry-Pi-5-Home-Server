# Raspberry Pi Home Server

I made a home server for a previously on my raspberry pi 3b+ and I wanted to make it again but better on my raspberry pi 5. Due to the pi 5 having a single-lane PCI Express 2.0 interface. I created this a while ago, just when the new pi 5 came out so recently checking there are official m.2 add-on but I got one that wasn't official but it reaches the speeds I expect. I put on a 1tb ssd as that's enough to store a lot of files but also relitively cheap compared to samsungs new 8tb m.2. I downloaded docker and then casaos, I like casa os because it allows you to have a graphical user interface in your browser, instead of having to ssh into the terminal to make things happen. Right now all it is used for it to store files and show a camera on the computer without using the app on the phone but I would like to expand this further with other things.

All it needs is power and that's it, I do use ethernet because it's faster and consistant.
